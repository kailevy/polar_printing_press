# POE Polar Printing Press Project

This repository will hold our code for our polar printing press. Our printing press will rotate and actuate markers in order to draw an image. 

## Python 

The Python parts of the code will process an image and convert this to a binarized or trinarized image. The Python code will convert this image into a set of polar drawing coordinates for the Arduino to read. 

## Arduino

The Arduino code reads from a CSV and controls the motors to draw the image.
